Metroid NES ROM Documentation
Area ROM Banks

==============================[ 1. Introduction ]===============================
The events of Metroid NES occur on the planet Zebes, which is divided into five
distinct Areas: Brinstar, Norfair, Tourian, Kraid's Hideout, and Ridley's
Hideout. The data for each of these Areas is located in a separate 16kb ROM bank
which is loaded at runtime into $8000-$BFFF of the NES address space.

While the main Game Engine ROM bank is relatively well documented, much of the
World ROM banks have not yet been labeled and commented.

Interestingly, about 47% of every Area ROM bank is identical to every other
Area ROM bank, containing common routines and data. Thus, an Area ROM bank may
be separated into the portion that is common to every Area bank ($8000-$8D5F and
$B200-$BFFF) and the portion that is different for each Area bank ($8D60-$B1FF).

================================[ 2. Common I ]=================================
This portion of the Area ROM bank is common to each Area bank. It begins at
$8000 and runs for $0D60 (3424) bytes. Much of the data in this section has been
documented in the disassembly, but the routines in this section remain
undocumented.

------------------------------[ 2.1 Jump Table  ]-------------------------------
The Jump Table consists of 24 "JMP $XXXX" instructions. These jumps all point to
addresses in the always-present Game Engine bank ($C000-$FFFF) or addresses in
this first Common I section ($8000-$8D5F).

It would be interesting to note where these instructions point to (only 4 of the
24 addresses are currently named/documented), and where these instructions are
called from. What is their purpose?

------------------------[ 2.2 Unknown routines/data  ]--------------------------

2.2.A: 8 WORDS
This section starts with 8 words (16 bytes). Interestingly, each of the words is
repeated once (the pattern is 0,1,2,2,1,0,3,3), and each of the words is the
address of a 'RTS' instruction at the end of a currently undocumented routine in
this common section.
    $84FD       RTS     Address 0
    $84A6       RTS     Address 1
    $844A       RTS     Address 2
    $844A       RTS     Address 2 (repeat)
    $84A6       RTS     Address 1 (repeat)
    $84FD       RTS     Address 0 (repeat)
    $83F4       RTS     Address 3 (repeat)
    $83F4       RTS     Address 3 (repeat)
    
2.2.B: Unknown routines
There are a number of routines in this section. I do not know what the purpose
of any of them are.

------------------------[ 2.3 Unknown routines/data  ]--------------------------
There are four routines in this section. I do not know what the purpose of any
of them are.

==============================[ 3. Area Specific ]==============================
This is the largest of the three sections of an Area Specific ROM Bank. It
contains graphics data and routines that area only called in this Area, and a
small amount of common data.

                                "JMP $EAEA" - expect that these are unused.
